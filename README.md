4. **Attach** necessary documents and multimedia.

## Notes
- The form is **front-end only**; server-side processing needs to be implemented separately.
- Some input attributes in the file have syntax errors (e.g., `input type=""text"`), which should be fixed before deployment.
- The file upload section accepts only specific file types (`image/*`, `.pdf`, `audio/*`, `video/*`).
- Navigation links use internal section IDs for smooth scrolling.
